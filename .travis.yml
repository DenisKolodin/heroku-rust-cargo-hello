# This Travis CI configuration allows us to test our example application
# against the latest version of the Rust compiler and our supporting
# libraries.
#
# This is only necessary because we want to update the example code
# whenever it falls out of date, to make life simpler for people creating
# new Heroku Rust applications.  If you're using this script in your own
# project, you probably want to install Rust from known-good tarballs and
# omit the "cargo update" step.
